## Introduction

This playground book that features a little bit of teaching, in a fun way, from one of the topics I like the most besides code, linguistics. It shows we are all related, since back then when, we all spoke the same language (putting it simply).
I used SwiftUI because I preferred the new paradigm and the change it means in the ways we write Views.

## Download

To experience this project, download the ".playgroundbook" file in this repository, and open it using Swift Playgrounds 3.3 or above for macOS (you can also use Playgrounds for iPad).
